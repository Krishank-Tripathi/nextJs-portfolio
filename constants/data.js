        `I've developed my interest in Comptuer Science when I was first introduce to C lanuage in 10th standard. I didn't know at that time the term for web development or javascript as this concepts are new to me. I went to write some blogs related to top apps & trending tech but diverted my attention to gaining knowledge from  medium & digital ocean blogs trust me they make a difference.`,
        `After learning HTML & CSS, in beggining I stuggle a lot with block & design but found the godfather of all design library i.e, bootstrap using this I gain much indepth knowledege of design based elemetns such as flex-box & container style with badass Row Col block attributes trust me they have save me every time,if you know bootstrap you know how to design. Trivia - did you know that India is no.1 in BootStrap as per Market Share & Web Usage Statics.`,
        `After improving my design I turned by back to backend tech i.e, NodeJs, well I didn't stop just there, I went through different web based library & Frameworks like React, NextJS & NestJS (Yes they are different). I've been coding in React, Node.js, Express, NextJS, NestJS, MongoDB, MySQL, Bootstrap, Tailwind, AWS Lamda, EC2, Cloudformation, Docker to name a few. I consider myself a developer in the making as you have always something new to learn & implement.`,
